# Redirects Configuration

# This configuration ensures that all navigation requests in the SPA are redirected to the `index.html` file.
# This is essential for a single-page application where the routing is handled client-side by React Router.

# Format:
# <source>  <destination>  <status_code>

# Redirect all traffic to `index.html`
# `/*`: Matches all paths
# `/index.html`: The target file where all requests are redirected
# `200`: The HTTP status code for a successful response
# The 200 status code is crucial as it tells the browser that the redirect is part of SPA routing and not an actual redirect.

/*    /index.html   200
